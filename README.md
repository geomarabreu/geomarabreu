### Self-Taught Programmer

Hi, I'm Geomar from Dominican Republic. Right now, my goals are to build my own business and help thousands (or millions) of people. I'm learning web development with The Odin Project. Maybe learn Python in the future for machine learning and algorithms. I have the idea of doing a master on cybersecurity, but I'm not sure. Regardless of what I do in the future, I just want to achieve financial and location freedom doing what I love.

#### My goal: Code for at least 1 hour every day without miss.
