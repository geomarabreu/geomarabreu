### Self-Taught Programmer

I'm currently using The Odin Project to learn how to code, and get a full-stack developer job as soon as I can. I don't have that much experience, but I'm willing to learn everything required to make it work. As with anything, it'll take a ton of effort, but even if I decide to go to college â€” which is possible and a great option â€” I'll try my best to learn everything needed to land my first job.

#### My goal: Code for at least 1 hour every day without miss.
